# NNIO package

[**nnio**](https://nnio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is a light-weight python package for easily running neural networks.

It supports running models on CPU as well as some of the edge devices:

  * [Google Coral Edge TPU](https://coral.ai/)
  * Intel integrated GPUs
  * [Intel Myriad VPU](https://www.intel.ru/content/www/ru/ru/products/processors/movidius-vpu/movidius-myriad-x.html)

For each device there exists an own library and a model format. We wrap all those in a single well-defined python package.
